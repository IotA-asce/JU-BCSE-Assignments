Best-first search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising
node chosen according to a specified rule. You need to implement greedy version of this search
algorithm and test them on following graph (A is the start node and G is the Goal node) and print
the Search sequence.

2. Iterative deepening depth-first search (IDDFS) is a state space search strategy in which a depth-
limited search is run repeatedly, increasing the depth limit with each iteration until it reaches d,

the depth of the shallowest goal state. Implement this search algorithm and test them on
following graph and print the Search sequence (A is the start state and N is the goal state).

3. Implement Uninformed Depth Limited Search considering 8-Puzzle Problem. Report Order of
nodes visited and Solution Path for the search technique.
4. Implement Uninformed Bi-directional Iterative Broadening Search considering Tree. Report Order
of nodes visited and Solution Path for the search technique.
